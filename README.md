This is an unofficial Homebrew custom tap to install https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile for OSX on Arm64.


To install the `llamafile` command run:

```sh
brew tap g-k/homebrew-llamafile
brew install llamafile
```

or `brew install --with-extras llamafile` to install the other binaries like whisperfile.


Note that llamafiles are also an executable format and can embed LLM models directly.
